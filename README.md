# DDos-attacK-prevention

this repo consists of two files

one for the DDos attack and the other is for detection and prevention 

## usage:

first run the detection code on the machine targeted for the attack 

second run the attack code and enter the target IP 

the attack code will send ICMP requests from random IPs to cause ICMP flooding 
then the detction program will detect this behaviour and block these IPs
